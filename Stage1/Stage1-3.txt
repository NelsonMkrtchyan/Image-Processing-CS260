In both Cases I used Binary Layer 2 , to detect the lips and contures of the nose and ears. I noticed that the heaight 
between lips (maximal horizontal distance) is quite similar in the photoes of the same person, and his face rotation angle or the fact of smiling does not change anything.
SO I can say that despite any rotation or smiling, the maximal distance between upper and lower lips will be the same, and always visible.
